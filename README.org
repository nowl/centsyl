This project was primarily an experiment to create a simple retro isometric shooter.
I had the classic Atari ST game [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Bandit][Time Bandit]] on my mind when I was working on this. It is
written in Rust and uses the following great libraries:
- Pixel (framebuffer on top of WGPU)
- Legion (entity component system)
- Rodio for audio
- bracket for pathfinding
- embedded-graphics for fonts

WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND=x11 cargo run --release
#+END_SRC

** Webassembly Build
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --features web
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/centsyl.wasm --out-dir wasm --no-modules --no-typescript
#+END_SRC
